- **Improve code examples** that don't work
- **Add missing installation steps**
- **Clarify confusing explanations**
- **Fix broken links**

#### ü•à Code Quality Improvements  
- **Add missing comments** to complex code
- **Fix code formatting** inconsistencies
- **Update deprecated function calls**
- **Add error handling** where missing

#### ü•â Small Feature Additions
- **Add configuration options**
- **Improve error messages**
- **Add simple utility functions**
- **Enhance CLI help text**

## Contribution Process

### 1. Repository Research
```bash
# Find suitable repositories
python scripts/pr_automation.py --interactive

# Check if you can contribute
- Look for CONTRIBUTING.md

```

### 2. Issue Selection
- Start with issues labeled `good first issue`
- Look for `help wanted` labels
- Choose issues with clear descriptions
- Avoid complex or controversial topics

### 3. Making Your Contribution

#### Documentation PR Example:
```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/your-username/target-repo.git
cd target-repo

# 2. Create branch
git checkout -b improve/readme-clarity

# 3. Make changes
# Edit README.md to fix typos, improve examples

# 4. Commit with clear message
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: fix typos and improve installation examples

- Corrected spelling errors in installation section
- Updated outdated command examples  
- Added clarity to troubleshooting steps"

# 5. Push and create PR
git push origin improve/readme-clarity
# Then create PR via GitHub web interface
```

## PR Best Practices
