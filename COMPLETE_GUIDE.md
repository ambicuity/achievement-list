# Complete Badge Earning Guide

## Quick Setup

1. **Get your GitHub Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select scopes: `repo`, `read:user`, `read:org`
   - Copy the token (keep it secure!)

2. **Set up environment** (IMPORTANT - keep token secure):
   ```bash
   # Method 1: Environment variable (recommended)
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"
   
   # Method 2: Using .env file
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your token (file is gitignored)
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

- **Galaxy Brain**: Answer GitHub Discussions
- **Starstruck**: Create popular open source projects

## Security Best Practices

- Rotate your tokens regularly
- Use minimal required scopes
- Keep tokens private and secure

## Troubleshooting

### "GitHub token required"
- Make sure `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is set
- Run `python scripts/badge_cli.py setup` to verify configuration

### "Permission denied" errors
- Check your token has correct scopes: `repo`, `read:user`, `read:org`
- Regenerate token if needed

### Badge not showing immediately
- GitHub badges can take 24-48 hours to appear
- Use `python scripts/badge_cli.py status` to verify automated actions worked
- Some badges require manual verification on GitHub's side

### Rate limiting
- The automation includes delays to avoid rate limits
- If you hit limits, wait an hour and try again
- Temporary repositories are automatically cleaned up
